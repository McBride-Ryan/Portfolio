# Ryan McBride's Portfolio

### Description 
Welcome to my page! You will encounter some videos, animaitons, and lots of HTML and CSS! I started out as a self taught programmer, and currently enrolled in MIT xPRO Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. We finished up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Next up is REACT JS!! We will be building projects and in the weeks to come we will be build full stack applications using NODE JS and MONGO DB. 

### Usage 
There is no need to install anything. It is a simple site that should take you through the different features it has to offer!

### Roadmap 
I'd love to include more animations for mobile users. I think it would be really cool to have the project cards to slide into frame when the user scolls down the page.
